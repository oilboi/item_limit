# THIS IS A MOD FOR MINETEST THAT UPGRADES ALL ITEMS TO THE MAX DEFINED AT THE TOP OF THE FILE (item_limit_stack_max) FOR MAX FUN!

Find yourself overwhelmed with items? TOO MANY mods installed for you to hold all those cool nodes!? This is your solution! 

The default redifined item stack is 999!

If you encounter any issues (which should not ever happen because everything is an optional dependancy!) then delete the mod.conf file in the mod folder and the mod storage file for the mod in the world folder for hard reset. Easy!
